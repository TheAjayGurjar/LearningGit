files having secret data or crucial setting
need not to be uploaded to remote repo

so i am hiding secrets.txt which contains
api keys and .DS_Store which contains
settings of my project by using gitignore feature

for that u have to create the .gitignore file which 
will be hidden in file explorer

without adding anything in the .gitignore file
if we use git add. it will add all the  files 
to staging area

so undo the staging process by using

git rm --cached -r .

in order to ignore any file just add the 
individual file name on separate line in 
.gitignore file 
in our case secrets.txt which contains
api keys and .DS_Store which contains
settings of my project

.gitignore file has certain settings too
like
# filename (can be used to ignore file
from getting ignored)
* .fileextention (used to ignore all files 
having that extention)
