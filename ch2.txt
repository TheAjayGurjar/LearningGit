till now we only created a local repo,
but we can also create a remote repo to
track the changes in the project

for that create a remote repo at github
then link the local git repo to the repo
on github by

git remote add origin https://github.com/TheAjayGurjar/LearningGit.git

origin simply the name of our remote

once connected push the local repo to
remote repo origin using 

git push -u origin master

master is the default branch of origin

we can use insight feature on github to 
track the branches of our github repo
